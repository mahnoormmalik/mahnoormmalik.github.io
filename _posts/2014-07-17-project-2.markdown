description: Developed a completed end to end IOT system to calculate the room comfort level measured by the Humidex. The system was built using DHT11 sensor to collect humidity and temperature sensor. The sensor was connected to an arduino with the ethernet module. The raspberry pi served as a server with Flask Rest API implementation which collected sensor data from the arduino and stored it locally in a database. The room sensor data was displayed on user UI using node-red.
